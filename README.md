# Face Recognition for Attendance

Attendnace methods at IE are below par in terms of comfort and UX for both the teacher and the students. This projects aims to simplify the process. 

The way this project works is the teacher runs the program, which will open a camera (using cv2 library in python) and each student shows their face to the camera as they enter the class. The program will detect each face (using the face_recognition library in python) and add it to the attendance list which will print out for the professor to see.
